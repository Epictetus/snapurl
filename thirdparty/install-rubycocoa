# Use this script only if you have a custom Ruby installation. If you are using
# the default from OS X (assuming you've got Leopard or Snow Leopard) then you
# don't need to run this script.
#
# Otherwise, you must also make sure that you built Ruby with the 
# --enable-shared flag on.
#
# If you want the latest, you can also pull it down from RubyCocoa's 
# repository:
#
# svn co \
#   https://rubycocoa.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rubycocoa/trunk \
#   tmp
#
INSTALL_DIR=`dirname "$0"`/..
cd $INSTALL_DIR/

# extract bundled RubyCocoa source
mkdir -p tmp
tar -C tmp -zxf thirdparty/rubycocoa-1.0.1.tgz

# build and install 
pushd tmp/rubycocoa-1.0.1
ruby install.rb config --target-archs='x86_64 i386'
ruby install.rb setup
sudo ruby install.rb install

# clean-up
popd
rm -r tmp
